### Phase 9: Deployment
- [x] Prepare application for deployment
- [x] Deploy backend
- [x] Deploy frontend (integrated with backend)

### Phase 10: Deliver Results and Documentation
- [x] Provide access to the deployed application
- [x] Document API endpoints (Done in README)
- [x] Document setup and usage instructions (Done in README and User Manual)
- [x] Document database schema (Done in README)
- [x] Document design choices (Done in README)

### Bug Fixes
- [x] Fixed frontend-backend communication for courts and players (Resolved by configuring Vite proxy, ensuring correct API calls from frontend, and adding cache control headers to backend responses.)
- [x] Fixed data persistence issue (Resolved by changing database path to an absolute path for persistence and correcting schema path in `database.py`.)
- [x] Fixed 500 errors on deployed backend (Resolved by correcting `main.py` and `database.py` for proper deployment environment setup and schema file path.)
